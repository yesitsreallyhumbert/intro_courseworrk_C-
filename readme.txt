================================ Questions ==================================

1. 
   I used a while loop in Haistone because there was a only
   a one value provided by the user, which meant I only had to
   loop while the value met my condition. 
   
:

2a. Once you've completed the second program, run hailstats on the following
inputs, and record your results in the table below:

  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |        6       |     64      |      118       |    97           
   100 200     |        7       |     128     |      124       |    171         
   200 400     |        8       |     256     |      143       |    327         

2b. 
    The minimum length continues to increase by incriments of 1 and
    it holds true because the range continues to double which would
    double the minimum value which is just one more loop through the 
    program.
:

3a.

X is : 703.

3b. 

: I followed the sequence of doubling the range as input (400, 800), then
continued to lower the range to (400, 700). It came up short of the
desired length then I continued to increase the upper limit of the range
by one. Notice 702 gave max limit of 144, then 703 gave me a max length
of 170.
